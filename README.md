# rocket-shooter
Old High School Final Project. Simple design/simple game. There is a rocket that shoots, their are aliens that multiply and their is a counter that I forgot to add for the game to even have scoring (plus a lot of nice bugs that a high school student at the time simply tried to hide when he couldn't fix them in time for submission :) )
